The authorization process utilizes two authorization server endpoints,
and one client endpoint. The former endpoints are HTTP resources, while
the latter is used to redirect ROs UA to the client. The former include
authorization endpoint and token endpoint, and the latter, redirection
endpoint.


Section 3.1 Authorization Endpoint

The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the resource
owner and obtain an authorization grant.

The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the
resource owner.  The way in which the authorization server authenticates
the resource owner depends on the security context.
(username and password login, session cookies)

OAuth 2.0 DOES NOT specify how this endpoint is discovered.

1. The endpoint URI MAY include an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    format, which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters
2. The authorization endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component.
3. The authorization server MUST require the use of TLS when sending
    requests to the authorization endpoint.
4. The authorization server MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET"
    for the authorization endpoint.
5. The authorization server MAY support the use of the "POST" method.
6. Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were
    omitted from the request.
7. The authorization server MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters.
8. Request and response parameters MUST NOT be included more than once.
