OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009
(rfc7009-oauth2-token-revocation.pdf)

A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if applicable,
other tokens based on the same authorization grant and the authorization
grant itself. Implementations MUST support the revocation of
refresh tokens and SHOULD support the revocation of access tokens.
    Notifying the authorization server that the token is no longer needed
    allows the authorization server to clean up data associated with that
    token (e.g., session data) and the underlying authorization grant.

Token revocation endpoint.
    HTTP Post request over TLS.
    Clients MUST verify that the URL is an HTTPS URL.
    The client requests the revocation of a particular token by making an
    HTTP POST request to the token revocation endpoint URL.

Comapre this with the requirement for the autorization endpoint.
It MUST support the use of HTTP GET method, and MAY support the use of
HTPP POST method.

Revocation request.
The client includess the following parameters using the
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format in the HTTP request entity-body:
    token   REQUIRED.  The token that the client wants to get revoked.
    token_type_hint  OPTIONAL.
        A hint about the type of the token submitted for revocation.
        This specification defines two values:
            access_token.
            refresh_token.

Example.
    POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    token=JSbdNrF...FOtMJw
    token_type_hint=refresh_token

if confidential client
    validates the client credentials.
verify whether the token was issued to the client making the revocation request.
if this validation fails
    immediately invalidate the token.
revoke all related tokens and the underlying authorization grant.
if the token passed to the request is a refresh token
    SHOULD also invalidate all access tokens based on the same authorization
    grant .
if the token passed to the request is an access token
    MAY revoke the respective refresh token as well.
ignore an invalid token type hint value
    invalid hint does not influence the revocation response.

Revocation Response
    The authorization server responds with HTTP status code 200 if the
    token has been revoked successfully or if the client submitted an
    invalid token.
    Reuses codes from RFC6749, Section 5.2 Error Response .
    An additional error code is defined for the token revocation endpoint:
    unsupported_token_type:
        The authorization server does not support the revocation of the
        presented token type.  That is, the client tried to revoke an
        access token on a server not supporting this feature.

If the server responds with HTTP status code 503, the client must
assume the token still exists and may retry after a reasonable delay.
    The server may include a "Retry-After" header in the response to
    indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the
    requesting client.
