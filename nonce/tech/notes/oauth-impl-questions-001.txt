Implementation Questions.

Section 2.3.1
Client Authentication

"Confidential clients are typically issued (or establish) a set of
client credentials used for authenticating with the authorization
server (e.g., password, public/private key pair)."
    How is the actually implemented?
    What authentication methods are ususlly supported?
    When is the client password allotted? During registration?

"Since this client authentication method involves a password, the
authorization server MUST protect any endpoint utilizing it against
brute force attacks."
    How do ASs protect against brute force attacks?
    Rate limiting, after N failed attempts?
    Locking the client for a period of time?
